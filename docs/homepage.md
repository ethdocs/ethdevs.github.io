Welcome to Ethdocs – a precision crowd-sourced curation of blockchain content and guides

Reading up on anything blockchain online can be daunting. A lot of overlap, mistakes, partial information, even misinformation, and more could make this task much more difficult than it should be. This is a general problem with finding information on the internet and we worked hard to try to solve this problem specifically in blockchain by using technology. We hope you find this system effective and that we help save you a lot of your precious time and energy which no other should be wasting.

The technology that we use allows us to “hover” over the internet together and to detach from many of its constraints. We are usually (new technology) able to select a very precise piece of information and to tag it in such a way that everyone can find it. On top of this, we’re also able to have conversations about each one of these captures. Huge shout out to the [Hypothes]( https://web.hypothes.is/) team for the best implementation of this critical technology so far. We are looking forward to helping you improve it.

If a picture can be worth 1000 words, then showing you how this technology works, if it is self explanatory (which it is) is probably worth even more. Go ahead and hop over to [your first example]( https://hyp.is/z4u7_oeuEemxbf8PXkKZyg/nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/)! We remind participants to have respect for this document and to generally keep their comments clean for everyone to enjoy. We will otherwise need to take action for the sake of the rest of our community. You can say hi and practice commenting [HERE]( https://hyp.is/CXH43IewEemxcBc1xLxiJg/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright). Feel free to pollute it. Make sure you created an account so you can start following along with us and by doing so help curate the blockchain corner of the internet for everyone else to enjoy at the same time.

### Initial guides (all in progress still)

### About
This project is the result of an open collaboration initiative by the [Zurich Blockchain RnD group](https://zbrd.org/) in switzerland and the [EthDevs.io](https://www.ethdevs.io/) team. We try to build free (also as in free beer, yes) blockchain communities to benefit all. Your contributions are very welcome.

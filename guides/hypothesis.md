# Installing Hypothesis


In order to follow our curation and to become a part of the conversation, you will need the Hypothes browser extension.
Hypothes is a tool that allows us to make annotations across the internet and to have discussions around them.
Hypothes also does a lot more and it's a very exciting and powerful piece of tech. With tools like these we can detach together from 
the confinements of the traditional way of exploring the internet. See you on the other side!

## To install on desktop:
Just follow our group [Blockchain programing](https://hypothes.is/groups/wg6R1aKJ/blockchain-programming). This should take you through the registration process and installation of the extension in Brave or Chrome.

## To install on Android:
We need a browser that can support the Hypothes chrome extension. We currently only know about Yandex and it does a pretty good job 
(though not perfect).

1. Download Yandex browser from your android device: [Yandex browser with protect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yandex.browser&hl=en)
2. In Yandex you can click this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek) and add the extension or find and add "Hypothesis - Web & PDF Annotation" through the 
google chrome store
3. In Yandex, go to menu -> extensions -> click Hypothes extension. The chat box should turn black instead of gray and you should now be able
to follow our curations and community.
